\appendix{\large\bf Appendix B: The Universal Cadence Strategy}

\bigskip

Strict optimization of each of the numerous science programs that LSST will
enable would certainly result in the same number of observing strategies.
However, thanks to the large \'{e}tendue, it is possible to design a universal
cadence that would result in a common database of observations to be used by
all science programs. An example of such a cadence is described here and
presented as a ``proof of concept'' rather than as a specific requirement
on the observing strategy. It does not address the possibility of deeper,
or more frequent, KBO and SNe surveys discussed in \S 3.4.

This, so-called ``universal cadence'', has a number of desirable properties,
and in particular, samples a wide range of time scales that are necessary for
time domain science. Equally important, the proposed cadence is invariant to
time translation and reversal, a feature that is desirable for a massive
steady-state synoptic sky survey. More details about this proposal are available
in the LSST Science Working Group report, and here only its essential
characteristics are described.

The strategy proposes two revisits closely separated in time (15-60 min)
to enable a robust and simple method for linking main-belt asteroids (MBA).
Their sky surface density is about two orders of magnitude higher than the
expected density of potentially hazardous asteroids (PHA), and thus MBAs
must be efficiently and robustly recognized in order to find PHAs. MBAs
move about 3-18 arcmin in 24 hours, which is larger than their typical
nearest neighbor distance at the depths probed by LSST (2.3 arcmin on the
Ecliptic). Two visits closely separated in time enable linking based on
a simple search for the nearest moving neighbor, with a false matching
rate of only a few percent.

With this cadence, it is possible to observe 20,000 $deg^2$ of sky
in about three nights, with two visits per field. The colors of
transients (such as SNe) and moving objects can also be measured by
using two different filters for the two visits (with a preference given
to the $r$ band).

Due to the proposed overlap between successive fields of view, about
17\% of the observed area represent multiple observations with a variety
of time scales. With a representative choice of various free parameters,
about 5\% of the observed area would be revisited within 25 sec.
Another 10\% of the area would be reobserved with a fairly uniform
sampling of time scales ranging from 25 sec to 15 min.
